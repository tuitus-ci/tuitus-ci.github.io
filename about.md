# Tuitus CI

Tuitus CI provides continuous integration and testing services for open source natural hazards engineering software. Our goal is to improve the quality, reliability, and reproducibility of research in this critical field.

Tuitus CI is part of the Tuitus Foundation, which supports an inclusive ecosystem of open source tools for natural hazards research. The Tuitus CI service focuses specifically on testing and CI/CD for these projects.

Key features and benefits of Tuitus CI:

  * Scalable CI testing on HPC infrastructure, enabling tests at real-world scales
  * Integrated workflow testing for multi-code scenarios (e.g. earthquake + landslide)
  * Reproducible notebook workflows using environment snapshots
  * Continuous deployment to DesignSafe-CI and other platforms
  * Unified API for distributed workflows and provenance tracking

By thoroughly testing natural hazards codes, fixing issues, and standardizing APIs, Tuitus CI enables researchers to have greater confidence in the predictions and decisions enabled by these software projects. We believe robust scientific software is essential for community safety.

Tuitus CI welcomes new projects and contributors. Please see our documentation for instructions on onboarding your natural hazards code with our testing services.

![Mission](mission.png)

The mission of the Tuitus Foundation is to support and sustain an inclusive, open source ecosystem for natural hazards engineering research. We aim to improve community resilience and safety by enabling the development, testing, and dissemination of reliable scientific software.

To accomplish this, the Tuitus Foundation will:
* Host an inclusive community of contributors who collaboratively advance open source natural hazards codes
* Provide continuous integration testing and infrastructure to enhance software quality and reproducibility
* Offer training, mentorship, and programs to onboard new open source developers
* Facilitate widespread adoption of trusted natural hazards tools through events, partnerships, and outreach
* Develop governance structures that encourage openness, diversity, and sustainability within the ecosystem
* Uphold ethics, transparency, and scientific rigor as core values across all foundation activities

Through this mission, we envision a future where high-quality open source software enables researchers, officials, and communities to make informed decisions that successfully mitigate natural hazards and risks, ultimately saving lives.
